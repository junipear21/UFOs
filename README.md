# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
-Dana and I worked on a website to make a dynamic table for UFO sightings. We used JavaScript, html, and css to accomplish this. The data was held in a a js file in the form of json. The website is styled using html and css.

## Results
The webpage is super simple to navigate. Upon opening the page, the viewer is presented with all the data. The table can be refined using certain criteria. The criteria can be put into the search fields located on the left side of the page. The four search areas are date, city, country, and shape.

## Summary
-With this design, there is no way to reset the filter. After the parameters have been filled, there is no going back. I would suggest a reset button that would clearthe parameters and show the table in its entirety again. My other suggestion would be to add some buttons that filter and reset the filter so there is more options than just pressing enter.
